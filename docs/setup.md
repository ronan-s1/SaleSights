# SaleSights Setup

## Run Locally üñ•Ô∏è

To run the app locally you need a MongoDB server and the Streamlit application running. It is recommend to use Python 3.10 for optimal compatibility.

### MongoDB

#### macOS (brew) 
If you are using macOS and have Homebrew installed, you should install MongoDB using the following command:
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
```

#### Windows
For Windows users, MongoDB can be installed by downloading the installer from the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

#### Linux
- For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    ```

- For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems:  
    ```bash
    sudo yum install -y mongodb
    sudo systemctl start mongod
    ```

**Note:**
If you plan to run `launch.py`, please make sure you have MongoDB installed using the appropriate method mentioned above, as this script relies on a MongoDB server for its functionality.
