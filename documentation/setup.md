# Setup SaleSights

## Run locally

To run the app locally you just need a MongoDB server and the streamlit app running.

**Python 3.10 or above**: You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### MongoDB

#### macOS (brew) 
If you are using macOS and have Homebrew installed, you should install MongoDB using the following command:
```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
```

#### Windows
For Windows users, MongoDB can be installed by downloading the installer from the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community).

#### Linux
- For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems:<br><br>
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

- For Red Hat/Fedora-based systems:  
```bash
sudo yum install -y mongodb
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Note:**
If you plan to run `launch.py`, please make sure you have MongoDB installed using the appropriate method mentioned above, as this script relies on a MongoDB server for its functionality.
